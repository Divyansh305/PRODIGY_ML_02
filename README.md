Task 2: Customer Segmentation

This project performs customer segmentation for a retail store, grouping customers based on their purchase behavior using K-means clustering. By identifying distinct customer segments, the store can customize marketing strategies and product offerings for different groups, enhancing customer satisfaction and driving sales.
Project Overview

In this analysis, customers are segmented based on:

    Purchase frequency: How often they make purchases.
    Total amount spent: Total spending in the store.

The dataset includes synthetic data to mimic a real-world retail scenario, providing insights into how frequently customers make purchases and their total expenditure. Using K-means clustering, the project identifies distinct customer segments.
Key Features

    Synthetic Dataset Generation: Code to create a synthetic dataset that models customer purchase frequency and spending.
    K-means Clustering: Code to apply K-means clustering to the dataset.
    Cluster Visualization: Visualizations to interpret customer clusters and their distinguishing features.
